## The Meaning of Life. OpenAI, ada model

**"What is the meaning of life?”** and I had no answer to give because I had no idea what my answer would be. I had spent an hour with people who were different from me but I did not think that I could ever understand them, in the same way that I could not relate to people who are ten years my senior. And yet, what I did understand was that life is a journey; it’s a journey of seeing the world in new ways, being open to new experiences, trying new things, and generally having a great time. And also, I know that I have never looked at a person who is different from me and thought, “Wow, that’s a really great person.”

As I was walking towards the exit of the mall I was thinking about the people who lived in the past who had come before me and how they had lived their life in such a way, and I thought about how they had been so good to each other and how they were so open to opportunities that they took on in their own way. I thought about how I have always been open to new experiences, and I thought that I would never be able to live my life in the way that I did.

I started to think about the people who lived in the past, and I thought that they had been good to each other, and I thought that they had been open to opportunities. And I thought about how I could never live my life in the way that they had lived it, and I thought that I would never be able to live my life in that way either.

I felt like I had to get out of there. And I thought, “I want to live my life in a way that makes sense to me. I want to live my life in a way that allows me to make my decisions. I want to live my life in a way that allows me to make myself happy. I want to live my life in a way that makes sense to myself.”

I was walking out of the mall. I was walking out of the mall with my pants still down. It was a beautiful day.
